Package: Anthropometry
----------------------

Version: 1.3 [2015-08-26]
* The former "stepArchetypesMod" function is now called "stepArchetypesRawData" to be more informative.
* The "anthrCases" and "trimmOutl" functions have been changed to S3.
* The vignette has been improved with some restructuring and cleaning to the sections.
* Submitted to CRAN.



Version: 1.2 [2015-05-07]
* Some helper funcions have been added. A function for identifying the anthropometric cases ("anthrCases"). A function for identifying the trimmed and outlier observations ("trimmOutl"). A function for plotting the projections of the shapes ("projShapes"). A function for computing the percentils of the archetypoids ("matPercs"). A function for defining the twelve bust sizes ("bustSizesStandard"). And a function for defining an array with the 3D landmarks of the sample objects ("array3Dlandm").
* The naming of variables, data sets and functions have been improved to be consistent, descriptive and informative.
* The "archetypoids" and "stepArchetypoids" functions have been adapted to return the "cand_ns", "cand_alpha" and "cand_beta" vectors with the nearest observations to archetypes.
* The vignette has been extended by incorporating comments to make it more accessible to readers from clothing design and working environments design and comments regarding the mathematical details behind each algorithm contained in the package. The general presentation of the examples has been also improved.
* Submitted to CRAN.



Version: 1.1 [2014-10-13]
* The "archetypoids" and "stepArchetypoids" functions return the alpha coefficients for the optimal set of archetypoids.
* The "LloydShapes" and "HartiganShapes" functions return the optimal clustering, optimal centers and optimal objective function also when a simulation study is carried out.
* The "TDDclust" function notifies if the optimal partition is obtained with PAM. 
* The vignette has been improved by pointing out the consequences of choosing different argument values in Section 5, by adding a new Section 6 to guide users in their choice of the different methods presented and by thoroughly checking the English.
* Submitted to CRAN.



Version: 1.0 [2014-03-07]
* First package version.
* Submitted to CRAN.
